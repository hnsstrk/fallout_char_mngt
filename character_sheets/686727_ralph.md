## Weapons

### Bare Hands

- **Damage**: 2 ()
- **Range**: close

### Knuckles

- **Damage**: 3 ()
- **Range**: close

Developed in antiquity, this weapon is nevertheless quite prevalent in the post-Great War wastelands. Brass Knuckles, or Knuckledusters, take the form of four linked metal rings in a shallow convex formation with a bumper attached to the concave face. The rings are slipped over a combatant&rsquo;s fingers with the bumper pressed into the palm of the hand. When a punch is thrown, the Brass Knuckles take most of the impact impulse, transferring much of the punch&rsquo;s kinetic energy to the target by way of the harder, smaller impacting surface of the metal knuckles. This drastically increases the likelihood of serious tissue disruption and bone damage.
Knuckles can accept one of the following mods which are installed with the Repair skill:
Knuckles: Sharp, Spiked, Puncturing, Bladed

### Machete

- **Damage**: 3 ()
- **Range**: close

A long, sharp knife designed to hack through dense or tough vegetation, the same properties that make it a useful tool also make it an effective weapon. While some machetes found in the wasteland were purpose-made blades, others are makeshift tools, typically made from a sharpened metal blade such as that salvaged from a lawnmower, bolted, tied, taped, or otherwise affixed to a simple handle.
Machetes can accept the following mod which is installed with the Repair skill:
Machete: Serrated Blade

### Ammunition

**Fusion Core** (x1)

Pre-War fusion cores are high-grade, long-term nuclear batteries. A single core can power a small building for a long time or provide a lot of power for something very quickly. Most suits of Power Armor accept a fusion core power source, which lasts for several hours of activity. They can also be used as the ammunition supply for a Gatling laser.
When discovered, a fusion core contains a number of charges equal to 10 plus the user&rsquo;s Science skill (people with more scientific knowledge can utilize the power more efficiently; the Nuclear Physicist perk also adds extra charges, see p.68). How these charges are used or depleted depends on what they&rsquo;re plugged into (see Power Armor, p.123).
When used as the ammunition for a Gatling laser, each charge a fusion core contains translates to 50 shots for a Gatling laser. As a Gatling weapon, the Gatling laser consumes ammunition ten times as quickly as most weapon (see Gatling, p.90).
The Scavenger perk cannot increase the number of fusion cores found.
Quantity Found: [[/r 1 # Fusion Core]]

## Apparel

### Custom Supermutant Left Leg

**Covers**: LEGL

**Resistances**: Physical +2, Energy +2

### Raider Chest Piece

**Covers**: TORSO

**Resistances**: Physical +1, Energy +1

Makeshift armor employed by raiders and other cutthroat types across the wastes. It varies considerably in quality and appearance but tends to be made of scrap metal rudely battered into shape, reinforced by metal bars, wire, and leather straps. This barbaric appearance is often bolstered by grisly trophies such as skulls or other body parts.
Each piece of raider armor can accept two mods, one of which is a Material, the other of which is an Upgrade. For mods applied to Torso armor, double the weight and cost (this has already been done for Torso Only mods). Super mutant characters may only wear Raider armor. All Raider Armor Material mods are installed with the Repair skill.
Raider Armor: Welded, Tempered, Hardened, Buttressed

## Consumables

### Mole Rat Meat (cooked) (x9)

A chunk of meat taken from a dead mole rat.
Mole rat meat can be cooked to make Mole Rat Chunks.

### Mutt Chops (x8)

Cuts of mongrel dog meat cooked to make them more nutritious and edible.

### Purified Water (x14)

Water which has been cleansed of any contaminants or radiation. Sometimes found in sealed cans or bottles in the wasteland, but often produced by taking water from other sources and boiling or filtering it. Locations with water pumps tend to tap into uncontaminated aquifers deep underground, giving them a consistent supply of clean water highly sought-after by survivors in the wasteland. In places where water is scarce, access to purified water is a precious commodity.

### Silt Bean (x3)

Growing from the vine of a silt bean plant, silt beans are red-brown pods of legumes growing in the wilderness. They&rsquo;re not easily cultivated for farming, though many have tried. The beans are an ingredient in a few recipes, such as radstag stew.

## Gear & Miscellany

### Chip Card

### Doctor's Bag

A well-stocked bag of medical supplies and useful tools for the science of healing. A bit cumbersome to haul around, but the people whose lives you save will thank you for the effort.
A doctor&rsquo;s bag may also contain one-use medical supplies like Stimpaks, purified water, and RadAway. These are tracked and used separately.

### Geiger Counter

A Geiger counter is a relatively simple tool, used to detect ionizing radiation. This is displayed on a small gauge, and signaled by a characteristic ticking sound, a common feature of counters, generated by the electronics for easy detection and monitoring of radiation.

### Med-Kit (locked)

### Mole Rat Tooth (Legendary)

### Old Key

### Pocket Watch

### Pre War Tie

### Vulture Beak

### Vulture Head

### biometric scanner (1 bei Ellie) (x3)

### copper cable (x4)
