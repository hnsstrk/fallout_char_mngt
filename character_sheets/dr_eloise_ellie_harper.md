Switchblade: Serrated Blade

### Ammunition

**10mm Round** (x10)

One of the most common types of pistol round found in the wastelands, manufactured in vast quantities before the Great War to accompany the large numbers of 10mm pistols they were producing as sidearms for soldiers, and as personal defense weapons for civilians.
Quantity Found: [[/r 8+4dc # 10mm Round]]

## Apparel

### Casual Hat

**Covers**: HEAD

A simple, lightweight hat, normally with a peak or brim to keep the sunlight out of the wearer&rsquo;s eyes.
Special: A character wearing a casual hat ignores any difficulty increases caused by extremely bright light.
Brauner Cowboy Hut aus Oasis Springs.

### Formal Clothing

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

A nice suit, a pretty dress, or some other kind of fancy, tailored clothing. Designed to be more flattering than functional, formal clothing is helpful when you need to impress someone, and is often prized as a sign of status, presenting the appearance of someone who doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about their own safety.
Special: Wearing formal clothing allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one CHA-based skill test you make each scene, as the clothing helps you make a good first impression.
Formal clothing can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar, p. 126).

### Formal Hat

**Covers**: HEAD

A smart-looking hat, that&rsquo;ll look the part adorning your head during a business engagement or formal event. Or just because you like how it looks and it keeps the sun off your face. Many examples are somewhat battered and worn from neglect and ill-use, but they&rsquo;re still functional.
Special: Wearing a formal hat allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one CHA-based skill test you make each scene, as it helps you make a good first impression.
Formal hats can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar).

### Lab Coat

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

A white coat&mdash;though likely stained or dirty&mdash; intended for use in a laboratory environment. Normally contains a useful number of pockets, and clock or sensor just below the left lapel, where it can be easily checked without having to reach for it&mdash;ideal during delicate scientific work.
Special: Between the utility of the design, and simply feeling smarter while wearing one, a lab coat allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one INT based skill test you make each scene.
A lab coat can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar, p. 126).

### New Apparel

### Vault Jumpsuit

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

**Resistances**: Energy +1, Radiation +2

The standard garment for all vault inhabitants, provided by Vault-Tec. A close-fitting blue jumpsuit with a golden-yellow strip running around the neck, down the torso, and along the sleeves. This strip is a metallic foil which aids in heat dissipation and works with the suit&rsquo;s integrated biometric scanners. Each Vault Jumpsuit has a number on the back, signifying which vault it originated from.
A Vault Jumpsuit can be modified with an additional protective lining, taking one of the mods below. All Vault Jumpsuit mods are installed with the Repair skill.
Vault Jumpsuit: Insulated Lining, Treated Lining, Resistant Lining, Protective Lining, Shielded Lining

## Consumables

### Mentats

Mentats were a popular recreational and performance-enhancing drug before the Great War, which enhance memory and speed mental processes. It was popular amongst students studying for exams, and amongst armchair philosophers and those in jobs requiring intensive thought. The effect lasts only a short time, leaving the user feeling tired and unfocused afterwards, and they are addictive by design, with withdrawal causing migraines and irritability.
Mentat Addiction: A failed addiction roll renders you addicted to Mentats. You increase the difficulty of all CHA tests by +1 whenever you are not under the effects of a type of Mentat (ordinary Mentats, or the Berry, Grape, or Orange versions).

### Purified Water

Water which has been cleansed of any contaminants or radiation. Sometimes found in sealed cans or bottles in the wasteland, but often produced by taking water from other sources and boiling or filtering it. Locations with water pumps tend to tap into uncontaminated aquifers deep underground, giving them a consistent supply of clean water highly sought-after by survivors in the wasteland. In places where water is scarce, access to purified water is a precious commodity.

### RadAway (x4)

An intravenous drug which purges radiation from the user&rsquo;s body, absorbing radiation as it circulates through the user&rsquo;s bloodstream. It&rsquo;s also a potent diuretic, expelling the radiation with the user&rsquo;s urine, so it&rsquo;s advisable to drink a lot of (clean) water shortly after taking a dose. Sometimes encountered in a diluted form, reducing its effectiveness as the user is only taking a partial dose. Diluted RadAway is only about half as effective, but it&rsquo;s easier to find.
Use: RadAway can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the Take Chem minor action, healing 4 Radiation damage immediately, or it can be applied as part of a First Aid action, healing 4 Radiation damage in addition to any other healing done (remove Radiation damage before applying other healing effects). Diluted RadAway works in the same way, but only heals 2 Radiation damage.

### Stimpak (x3)

A stimulation delivery package, or Stimpak, is a form of fast-acting medication used to bolster the body&rsquo;s own healing and recuperative ability, and countless millions were produced for household and workplace first aid kits, hospitals, clinics, and other places. A wonder of pre-War science, a Stimpak is a single-use syringe filled with a variety of potent healing agents, stimulants, and painkillers, and can be applied in an intravenous or intramuscular fashion: literally stick it anywhere and it&rsquo;ll work. Even so, it a Stimpak is most effective when applied by an Auto-Doc or someone with medical training alongside other treatment.
Sometimes encountered in a diluted form, reducing its effectiveness as the user is only taking a partial dose. Diluted Stimpaks are only about half as effective, but they&rsquo;re easier to find.
Use: A Stimpak can be used in one of two ways: it can be applied using the Take Chem minor action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury immediately, or it can be applied as part of a First Aid action, healing 4 HP or treating an Injury in addition to any other healing done. Diluted Stimpaks work in the same way, but only heal 2 HP, though they can still treat Injuries as normal.

## Gear & Miscellany

### Apotheker von Gestern Band I - Book/Magazine

### Desinfektionsmittel

### Doctor's Bag

A well-stocked bag of medical supplies and useful tools for the science of healing. A bit cumbersome to haul around, but the people whose lives you save will thank you for the effort.
A doctor&rsquo;s bag may also contain one-use medical supplies like Stimpaks, purified water, and RadAway. These are tracked and used separately.

### First Aid Kit

A pack full of bandages, antiseptic spray, and other tools useful in helping clean and bind injuries in the field. First aid kits also often come with Stimpaks and RadAway, but these are used and tracked separately

### Glowing Goo (x3)

### Multi-Tool

A handy little device, containing a set of pliers, some wire cutters, a variety of small wrenches and screw drivers, and other small tools, all built into a single tool. Different parts fold out of the handles as needed. Ideal for someone who needs basic tools but is still travelling light.

### Pip-Boy

A Personal Information Processor manufactured by RobCo Industries. Under partnership with Vault-Tec, they were issued to many vault residents, though due to production constraints and ongoing development, different vaults received shipments of different versions of the Pip-Boy. The versions most encountered are variants of the Pip-Boy 2000 and Pip-Boy 3000, which are designed to be secured upon the wearer&rsquo;s wrist. Many models were designed with biometric locks, preventing them from being removed while the wearer still lives.
A Pip-Boy is powered by an internal fission battery, providing a working lifespan for the device far greater than the expected life of its wearer (and, indeed, many Pip-Boys have been handed down within communities or families as heirlooms), and the device itself is sturdy enough to withstand basically anything.
Not all Pip-Boys contain the same functions, but the common functions are:
A personal status indicator allows the wearer to see a report on their current health and wellbeing and any medical problems currently afflicting them.
The device maintains an ongoing log of the wearer&rsquo;s activities, journey, and condition, and place for personal recordings to be made in either text or audio forms.
An inbuilt holotape reader allows the device to accept compact holotapes, able to read and playback audio, video, data, and even games.
It also functions as a compass, a radio, and a Geiger counter, and can generate light from its screen equivalent to a flashlight.
In addition, all Pip-Boy units aid their wearer during combat thanks to the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. A character equipped with a Pip-Boy may use V.A.T.S. when they make an attack, ignoring the normal difficulty increase for targeting a specific location on the enemy.
