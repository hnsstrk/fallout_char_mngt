## Trait

### Vault Kid

Your healthier start to life at the hands of trained doctors and sophisticated auto-docs means you reduce the difficulty of all END tests to resist the effects of disease. In addition, your carefully-planned upbringing means you have one additional tag skill of your choice.
You may also work with the Gamemaster to determine what sort of experiment took place within your Vault. Once per quest, the GM may introduce a complication which reflects the nature of the experiment you unwittingly took part in, or introduce a complication related to your early life of isolation and confinement within the Vault. If the GM does this, you immediately regain one Luck Point.

## Apparel

### Casual Hat

**Covers**: HEAD

A simple, lightweight hat, normally with a peak or brim to keep the sunlight out of the wearer&rsquo;s eyes.
Special: A character wearing a casual hat ignores any difficulty increases caused by extremely bright light.
Brauner Cowboy Hut aus Oasis Springs.

### Formal Clothing

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

A nice suit, a pretty dress, or some other kind of fancy, tailored clothing. Designed to be more flattering than functional, formal clothing is helpful when you need to impress someone, and is often prized as a sign of status, presenting the appearance of someone who doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about their own safety.
Special: Wearing formal clothing allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one CHA-based skill test you make each scene, as the clothing helps you make a good first impression.
Formal clothing can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar, p. 126).

### Formal Hat

**Covers**: HEAD

A smart-looking hat, that&rsquo;ll look the part adorning your head during a business engagement or formal event. Or just because you like how it looks and it keeps the sun off your face. Many examples are somewhat battered and worn from neglect and ill-use, but they&rsquo;re still functional.
Special: Wearing a formal hat allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one CHA-based skill test you make each scene, as it helps you make a good first impression.
Formal hats can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar).

### Lab Coat

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

A white coat&mdash;though likely stained or dirty&mdash; intended for use in a laboratory environment. Normally contains a useful number of pockets, and clock or sensor just below the left lapel, where it can be easily checked without having to reach for it&mdash;ideal during delicate scientific work.
Special: Between the utility of the design, and simply feeling smarter while wearing one, a lab coat allows you to re-roll a single d20 on one INT based skill test you make each scene.
A lab coat can be reinforced with Ballistic Weave (see sidebar, p. 126).

### New Apparel

### Vault Jumpsuit

**Covers**: ARML, ARMR, LEGL, LEGR, TORSO

**Resistances**: Energy +1, Radiation +2

The standard garment for all vault inhabitants, provided by Vault-Tec. A close-fitting blue jumpsuit with a golden-yellow strip running around the neck, down the torso, and along the sleeves. This strip is a metallic foil which aids in heat dissipation and works with the suit&rsquo;s integrated biometric scanners. Each Vault Jumpsuit has a number on the back, signifying which vault it originated from.
A Vault Jumpsuit can be modified with an additional protective lining, taking one of the mods below. All Vault Jumpsuit mods are installed with the Repair skill.
Vault Jumpsuit: Insulated Lining, Treated Lining, Resistant Lining, Protective Lining, Shielded Lining

Laborkittel
Spezial: Abgesehen davon, dass er praktisch gestaltet ist und du dich einfach schlauer f&uuml;hlst, wenn du ihn tr&auml;gst, darfst du mit einem Laborkittel bei einer INT-basierten Fertigkeitsprobe pro Szene einen einzelnen W20 neu w&uuml;rfeln. Ein Laborkittel kann mit ballistischem Gewebe verst&auml;rkt werden (siehe Kasten S. 126).
Dein ges&uuml;nderer Start ins Leben in den H&auml;nden ausgebildeter &Auml;rzte und fortschrittlicher Auto-Docs reduziert die Schwierigkeit aller AUS-Proben, um den Auswirkungen von Krankheiten zu widerstehen, um &ndash;1. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus bedeutet deine sorgf&auml;ltig geplante Erziehung, dass du eine zus&auml;tzliche Spezialfertigkeit deiner Wahl erh&auml;ltst.
